# Hello-GitWorld
not another tutorial repository

This is a file not like the others, where changes are made -commitments or druthers.
And while the master remains secure and intact, some ideas ferment from the bottom to up.
In the final they rise deep-rooted to bottom, to become something other or as masters to pot 'em.
